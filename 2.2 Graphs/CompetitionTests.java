/*
 * 	
 *  
 *  Justify the choice of the data structures used in CompetitionDijkstra and CompetitionFloydWarshall:
 *  Directed Graph for the roads so that the functions will apply
 *  PQ as faster than 2d array but less complicated fibionacci heaps
 *  
 *  Explain theoretical differences in the performance of Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall algorithms in the given problem. 
 *  Also explain how would their relative performance be affected by the density of the graph. 
 *  Which would you choose in which set of circumstances and why?
 *  
 *  Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is one example of a single-source shortest, given a source vertex it finds shortest path from source to all other vertices.
 *  Floyd Warshall Algorithm is an example of all-pairs shortest path algorithm, meaning it computes the shortest path between all pair of nodes.
 *  
 *  Dijkstra has a run time of VlogV, as the graph gets larger it will take longer
 *  Floyd-Warshall has a run time of V^3, as the graph get larger this will take longer.
 *  
 *  Floyd Warshall is better for dense graphs but Dijkstra is better in general
 *
